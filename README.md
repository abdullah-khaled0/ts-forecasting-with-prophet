# Time Series Forecast with Prophet

![](https://www.timescale.com/blog/content/images/2022/06/candlesticks-2.png)

## üìö Introduction
This repository demonstrates a time series forecasting project using **Prophet**, Facebook's open-source library designed for forecasting tasks. In this project, we aim to forecast stock prices. It's important to note that historical prices alone do not indicate whether a price will rise or fall. Instead, we will leverage additional variables and utilize machine learning techniques for stock price prediction, going beyond mere historical analysis.

## üîç Summary about Prophet
Facebook's research team developed Prophet to provide an accessible implementation of forecasting methods. As noted in their blog, high-quality forecasting data produced by analysts is rarely seen, which motivated the creation of this library. Prophet offers an approachable way for both experts and non-experts to utilize advanced time series forecasting concepts. It closely resembles the Scikit-Learn API, making it familiar for Python users. For more detailed insights, you can refer to the [Prophet Blog](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/).
